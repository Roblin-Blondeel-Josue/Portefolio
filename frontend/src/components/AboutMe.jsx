          Hello, my name is Josu√©, from Strasbourg. I'm a young develeppor web.
          I began to learn web developping starting on September 2022. I love to
          work with ReactJs and NodeJs to create new websites. Recently, I began
          the study of FramerMotion library to create little animation for my
          website.
          <br />
          <br />
          Self-taught, I learned a bit of Computer Aided Design for 3D printing,
          as well as what concerns the Arduino. I got a big interest for the
          domotic and IoT. I'm starting to study and try to work on a magic
          mirror with RaspBerry.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of work, I'm a SF/Fantasy lover. I have plenty of hobbies
          which includes doing a role-play game, read novels or books and
          sometime try to write some stories. In other case, I'm LARP entousiasm
          and as a player, I like to create and play a character. And as a game
          master, I write stories and leave my players to do all sort of stuff.
          All emotions that they feel, is one of my pleasure.
